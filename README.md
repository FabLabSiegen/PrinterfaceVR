The VR Part of this Project is copied and pasted from 3 Projects to test my Octoprint Interface in VR combining two of the most exciting new technologies of the second decade of the 21 Century in an so far utterly useless but i.m.O. funny Fashion

The base Construct of the VR implementation is a bold copy from
Bastiaan Olij's OpenVR Test scene for the Godot gameengine
https://github.com/BastiaanOlij/godot_openvr

The 3D Printer is a lower-poly copy of the complete Prusa3d CAD model from jzkmath
https://github.com/jzkmath/Original-Prusa-i3/tree/MK3

The Octoprint interface dll is a version of my C# Interface for Octoprint Printerface
https://github.com/FabLabSiegen/Printerface/tree/master/Printerface

The Project can be edited with Godotengine Version 3.1 with Mono support (Mono Version 5.12, no later, no earlier, only 5.12 works), i'm currently using Alpha 2 if you want to use this productively i'd reccommend copying most into a Version of BastianOlij's godot_openvr Project that uses a stable Godotengine Version.

Following are the usual instructions from BastianOlij's godot_openvr Test scene, as they apply to this Scene as well.

# GDNative based OpenVR plugin for Godot

This is a GDNative based plugin that adds OpenVR support to Godot.

The leading version of this repository now lives at:
https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_openvr

**note** The master on this repository is now kept in sync with the Godot master.
To build versions for official releases of Godot please check the branches that are named in sync with the Godot release.

Submodules
----------
This project references two submodules. If you do not already have these repositories downloaded somewhere you can execute:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
To download the required versions.

Godot_headers is a git repository that keeps a copy of the headers needed for compiling GDNative modules. We try to keep the version of the files in sync with the version of Godot this branch relates.

If it is outdated you can use the switch headers to the location of more recent files which will be inside of your Godot source after compiling in the folder modules/gdnative/include.

OpenVR is a git repository maintained by Valve that contains the OpenVR SDK used to interact with the OpenVR/SteamVR platform.
Alternatively you can use the switch openvr or set the environment variable OPENVR_PATH to the location where you have downloaded a copy of this SDK.

Compiling
---------
Scons is used for compiling this module. I made the assumption that scons is installed as it is also used as the build mechanism for Godot and if you are building from source you will likely need to build Godot as well.

You can compile this module by executing:
```
scons platform=windows target=release
```

Platform can be windows, linux or osx. OSX is untested.

Deploying
---------
Note that besides compiling the GDNative module you must also include valves openvr_api.dll (windows), libopenvr_api.so (linux) or OpenVR.framework (Mac OS X). See platform notes for placement of these files.
The godot_openvr.dll or libgodot_openvr.so file should be placed in the location the godot_openvr.gdnlib file is pointing to (at the moment bin).

Mac notes
---------
Mac is currently untested, I unfortunately do not have the required hardware. If anyone wants to hold up their hands, please contact me :)

Linux notes
-----------
On Linux, Steam will not automatically add the SteamVR libraries to your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable. As such, when starting Godot (for development) or your game outside of Steam, it will fail to load the required libraries.

There are a couple of ways to fix this:

1) Launch Godot or your game from within Steam

2) Run Godot or your game through the steam runtime manually (change the path to suit your Steam installation):

```
/home/<user>/.steam/steam/ubuntu12_32/steam-runtime/run.sh <your command>
```

3) Adjust your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable accordingly:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"/path/to/libgodot_openvr.so/dir/":"/home/<user>/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/"
```

You can place the libopenvr_api.so file alongside the libgodot_openvr.so file in the bin folder. You can find this file in: openvr/bin/linux64

Windows notes
-------------

Windows generally works without any special needs. I've tested compiling with MSVC 2017, others have tested 2015. With 2017 be aware Microsoft now lets you pick and choose which components you install and by default it may not install the SDK you need. Make sure to install both the Windows SDK and build tools.

Also when deploying users may need to first install the correct redistributable you can find here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads
I am not 100% sure this is a requirement as it automatically installs this when installing MSVC but past experiences and such... :)

For Windows you need to supply a copy of openvr_api.dll along with your executable which can be found in openvr/bin/win64

HDR support
-----------
OpenVR does not accept Godot's HDR color buffer for rendering, so your scene may receive position and rotation information and display correctly on the desktop but won't render anything inside your headset. 

HDR support for the headset is currently being evaluated through PR:
https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/19724
This PR allows Godot to use full HDR rendering but has the last step in post processing do a conversion to RGBA8 which Godot does support.

If you are building Godot without this PR or using the stable version, you will have to set `hdr` to `false` on your viewport in addition to enabling `arvr`: 

```
func _ready():
    var interface = ARVRServer.find_interface("OpenVR")
    if interface and interface.initialize():
        get_viewport().arvr = true
        get_viewport().hdr = false
```

GLES2 support
-------------
The new GLES2 renderer in Godot 3.1 renders directly to RGBA8 buffers and thus doesn't need the HDR workaround. The GLES2 renderer is also much more lightweight then the GLES3 renderer and thus more suited for VR.

Using the main viewport
-----------------------
The ARVR server module requires a viewport to be configured as the ARVR viewport. If you chose to use the main viewport an aspect ratio corrected copy of the left eye will be rendered to the viewport automatically.

You will need to add the following code to a script on your root node:

```
var interface = ARVRServer.find_interface("OpenVR")
if interface and interface.initialize():
	# turn to ARVR mode
	get_viewport().arvr = true

	# turn HDR off, not needed with the GLES2 renderer
	get_viewport().hdr = false

	# make sure vsync is disabled or we'll be limited to 60fps
	OS.vsync_enabled = false
	
	# up our physics to 90fps to get in sync with our rendering
	Engine.target_fps = 90
```

Using a separate viewport
-------------------------
If you want control over the output on screen so you can show something independent on the desktop you can add a viewport to your scene.

Make sure that you turn the ARVR property of this viewport to true and the HDR property to false.
Also make sure that both the clear mode and update mode are set to always.

You can add a normal camera to your scene to render a spectator view or turn the main viewport into a 2D viewport and save some rendering overhead.

You can now simplify you initialisation code on your root node to:

```
var interface = ARVRServer.find_interface("OpenVR")
if interface:
	interface.initialize()

	# make sure vsync is disabled or we'll be limited to 60fps
	OS.vsync_enabled = false
	
	# up our physics to 90fps to get in sync with our rendering
	Engine.target_fps = 90
```
